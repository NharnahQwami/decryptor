# SecurDecrypt Script

This Python script allows you to perform decryption using various cryptographic methods including ROT13, Base64, Caesar's Cipher, and Hexadecimal encoding. It provides a menu for selecting the decryption method and prompts for input, making it easy to use.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python3 installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependencies by running: <br>
   <code> pip install -r requirements.txt> </code>

3. Run the script with the following command: <br>
   <code> python3 decryptor.py </code>

4. Select a decryption method from the menu and, if applicable, enter the Caesar's cipher key.

5. Enter the text to be decrypted or provide a file path (if the text is in a file).

6. The decrypted text will be displayed on the screen.

## Available Decryption Methods

- **ROT13**: A simple letter substitution cipher.
- **Base64**: Decodes Base64-encoded text.
- **Caesar's Cipher**: Decrypts text using a specified key.
- **Hexadecimal**: Decodes hexadecimal-encoded text.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Python libraries (specified in requirements.txt)
